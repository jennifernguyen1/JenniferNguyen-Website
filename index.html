        <div class="subheading mb-5">Biochemistry 📚</div>
        <p class="lead mb-4">I am a freshman majoring in Biochemistry at the University of California, Riverside (UCR). My passion for biochemistry stems from a strong interest in medicine and the human body from a young age, as my favorite toys as a kid were those pretend doctor set, with toy syringes and needles. I was always running around with my scrubs outfit and toy stethoscope. In high school, my favorite classes were always part of the sciences, specifically chemistry and biology. I also grew to love research during this time, as I spent countless hours working in a research lab where we experimented on petri dishes of bacteria. I once took a course at a community college where I was really fascinated by the labs the professor was conducting, so I asked to join his chemistry lab. From there, I gained knowledge about chemistry that I could not learn simply from traditional schooling or from textbooks by participating in the professor’s chemistry lab. While I was working in the chemistry lab, I had the opportunity to test different chemical reactions, many of which also occurred during the process of forming medication. I didn’t know much about pharmacology before this, but this experience gave me a chance to learn about another side of medicine that I was not yet exposed to.<br><br>

        I also volunteered at a local hospital, Kaiser Permanente, during my high school years, further cementing my love for medicine and just science in general. There, I met many like-minded people who are as interested as I was in either the field of medicine or scientific research. I also met many doctors, nurses, pharmacists, and other staff members who were great mentors to me, as they gave me tons of advice about medicine and just life in general. I also like to participate in events for certain causes, such as the Walk to End Alzheimer’s and Relay for Life. Relay for Life is an event in which people run or walk a marathon course to help raise money for cancer research. The Walk to End Alzheimer’s is similar to Relay for Life, but its participants are required to walk the entire marathon course, not run. The causes are also different, for the purpose of Relay for Life is to raise awareness and money for cancer research whereas the Walk to End Alzheimer’s is aimed towards research on Alzheimer’s disease.<br><br>

        When I am not studying biochemistry, my favorite activities are to go ice skating, play the piano, and bake. I am not particularly great at any of the activities I previously listed, but I enjoy them, and that is all that matters when it comes to hobbies. I just need to be good at my job; my competency for my hobbies are not of much importance to me. I currently do not have any pets because I have a small fear of being bitten by dogs, but once I get over that fear, I would love to get a dog one day, preferably a Shiba Inu, a golden retriever, or a Pomeranian.
